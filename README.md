Make sure you understand
[basic oauth tutorial](https://github.com/env3d/oauth-basic-tutorial).

Then, look at the comments in index.html file, should be self explanatory.

# How to run

You'll need to run this on localhost:5000, I installed the lite-server npm package for this purpose

```
   npm install -g lite-server
```

Then you simply run `lite-server` in the current directory. The live version can be see at
